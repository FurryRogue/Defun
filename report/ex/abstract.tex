In chapter 3 and 5 of the book {\it Principles in Program Analysis}\cite{PoPA},
a constraint based control flow analysis is suggested and formalized.
The analysis produces inter-procedural control flow information,
such as a list/cache of function names describing the set
of function definitions that can result in a given type.

The analysis i typically used in whole program transformations such as
John Reynolds's defunctionalizing transformation\cite{Reynolds1968,Reynolds1998}.
Which transforms higer-order programs into first-order ones.

In this project, we motivate, formalize and implement the analysis suggested in
chapter 5 in the style of a the anotated typesystem for the small higher
order programming language found in\cite{fun}.
Furthermore, we perform the transformation described in
Reynolds's article\cite{Reynolds1968},
and compare it to a control-flow version of the same transformation.
